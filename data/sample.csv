I haven't had a chance to go through and do all the tagging and referencing yet since work calls but I am extremely confident in the scientific factual basis of everything stated in here.  The referencing can pretty much be all made to the book """"Particle Imaging Velocimetry A practical guide"""" by Raffel, Willert, Wereley and Kompenhans if someone can add it.  Also, not sure how to exactly do that as it all can be found in numerous scientific journals, databases, etc. but is so conveniently placed all in that one book.The only thing I am unsure about as I have no experience with is Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.  To put it simply, I would like to keep technique defects in the summaries but I don't know what this one's is.  To put is bluntly, the description as it is now is too good to be true.  I know it has defects and problems, I don't know what they are.  The fact is the technique was developed in 97ish and is not in widespread use.  If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.Everything else, please post on discussion page before editing critical information as I am positive what I have said can be completely defended but am open to solid arguments.  I won't be pigheaded about it.Also, anyone with knowledge of tomographic PIV please expand the section.  It is a volumetric analysis technique that I know of and know its new, but know nothing about.""",0,0,0,0,0,0152276337,"Discussion should take place on the article talk page, not on a user's talk page.

I am intimidated by the number of images you possess (7000!). And though I am a painter and teacher, I am blissfully ignorant about most workings of the computer. I think that the best way to go would be to upload them to the commons, put captions on them, and place them under the proper headings (here I would also suggest you ask a more experienced art editor than I, someone like Wetman, Caravaggisti, Ewulp, or Celithimus, for their adviceyou will find their contributions throughout the histories of artists' entries... maybe they'll say I'm all wrong). The other option is to continue placing pictures in articles, but even when there are a lot of them, I actually hate deleting images once they are up, either because of my own reticence in undoing what others have done, or out of respect for the visual image. That being said, if there is any way I can help, I would be glad to. It is clear that you have a great collection of photos, and that you are very generous.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    20:03, 18""",0,0,0,0,0,0
